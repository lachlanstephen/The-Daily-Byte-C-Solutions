This question is asked by Microsoft. Given a linked list, containing unique numbers, return whether or not it has a cycle. 
Note: a cycle is a circular arrangement (i.e. one node points back to a previous node) 

Ex: Given the following linked lists...

1->2->3->1 -> true (3 points back to 1)
1->2->3 -> false
1->1 true (1 points to itself)
