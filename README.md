<h1>The Daily Byte Challenge - C Solution</h1>

<p>These are my solutions to The Daily Byte daily problems. The Daily Byte solutions are currently offered in Java, however, I'm attempting to keep up with my C programming, so thought I'd upload my C solutions as I go along.</p>

<p>If you're more interested in Python rather than C, I have another repo on my profile for Python I started a while before this, so feel free to check it out at <a href="https://github.com/lachlanstephen/The-Daily-Byte-Python-Solutions" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">My Daily Byte Python Solutions</a>. It should be noted, this repo will be more of a priority than the python, as I'm required to use C in the 42 Schools.</p>

<p>If you see any issues with my code or think I could improve the solution (whether it be in regards to time or space complexity, or anything at all), please let me know! (Probably by forking my repo and putting your own solution up with comments for me to see).</p>

<p>If you're interested in trying these problems out for yourself, I encourage you to sign up for The Daily Byte daily problems here at <a href="https://thedailybyte.dev" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">The Daily Byte</a>, and try not to look at my code till after you've completed your own responses.</p>

<p>To be clear, I am not sponsored or anything, I just think they're doing a good thing :)</p>
